          <h2>Cosmetics & Chemicals</h2>
          <p>Your beauty kit probably consists of shampoo, toothpaste, soap, deodorant, hair conditioner, lip balm, sun screen, body lotion and shaving products if you’re a man / makeup if you’re a woman. Children’s share would include sunscreen, diaper cream, shampoo and lotion.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics have always been popular especially in an ever-increasing fashion-aware global society that values outer appearance and elegance. This fact may come sometimes at odds with the health aspects of using cosmetics. The truth is that many of the ingredients used in personal care and beauty products aren’t as pretty as they make you look like.</p>
          <p>Researchers have found that one in eight of the 82,000 ingredients used in cosmetic and personal care products are hazardous industrial chemicals. This means that about 10,500 industrial chemicals are used as cosmetic ingredients, many of which are carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxins, endocrine disruptors, plasticizers (chemicals that keep concrete soft), degreasers (used to get grime off auto parts) and surfactants (they reduce surface tension in water, like in paint and inks). It does not take much imagination to give it a thought: “Yes, these 10,500 industrial chemicals penetrate our skin”!</p>
          <p>According to The Environmental Working Group www.cosmeticsdatabase.com, many of the ingredients used have not even been tested for human safety. This leaves us with little information on the consequences of using cosmetics, and perhaps, with even a smaller margin of hope that we won’t experience consequences after some years into the future. It is perhaps worth being more diligent about what you apply on your skin today because ultimately these chemicals will penetrate your skin and become part of your body; whether in a neutral or in a negative way (and to what extent), paves the way for a bigger discussion on cosmetics and available alternatives.</p>
